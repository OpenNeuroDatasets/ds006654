This dataset contains the data that form the basis for the publication "Effects of spatial fMRI resolution on the classification of naturalistic movies" by Mandelkow et al. (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.08.053), which were acquired at the National Institutes of Health under NINDS protocol 00-N-0082 in 2012-2015. Of the 10 subjects that were scanned for this study, data from only 7 were included in the manuscript. As a stimulus, participants viewed a 5-minute section (opening scence) of the movie 'The Matrix' (without audio).
